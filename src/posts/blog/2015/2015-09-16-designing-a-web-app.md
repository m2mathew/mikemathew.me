## Design Meetup @ The Iron Yard-Austin

I learned some [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) tonight! [Abby Larner](http://www.abbylarner.com/) led the meetup attendees through a small "pet" project. I have embarked on a quest multiple times over the years to learn Illustrator and Photoshop, but it always ended with me not figuring out how to select or delete or modify what I just created. These are such complicated programs!

We started with a [wireframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe) and needed to learn the use of some basic tools in Photoshop to create items and manipulate them. Honest truth, I was a slow learner here. Some of the tools' layouts seem counter-intuitive to me, even as a longtime Mac user (or maybe in _spite_ of that). I definitely made plenty of notes in my fancy [Baron Fig notebook](https://www.baronfig.com/pages/confidant) (with a dot grid) about keyboard shortcuts and the order of a needed workflow. This will prove valuable later when I have gotten hungry or distracted by some other aspect of life, and necessarily forgotten how to get anything done in PS.

On a practical note, using Photoshop will likely prove to be extremely useful to me as a developer. Designers will make a mock-up of a website and provide a .psd file (the proprietary format used by Adobe for a Photoshop file). This file will have the exact dimensions and colors needed to build a website from that design idea, which will allow me to create a pixel perfect recreation for the client (and designer!).

So, here's to many more encounters with this behemoth program. I have a feeling that, like with most deeper computer technology things, it will prove to be a long road to get the most out of it. Perhaps I will even get a high-quality camera and learn to **really** use the program for it's original intent!
