Some of the previous iterations of my personal blog posts include "musings", talking about life in general. I'm renaming these to "VibeCheck" to better reflect the content and structure of these posts. In the spirit of posting information on my own site and taking back control of my _content_ (I'm saying that word in my head like Merlin Mann (Google him!)), I like the idea of random vibe checks to write down what was happening in my world at various points. I'm not the best at remembering what was happening in my own life, so these types of posts can help future-me recall what was going on.

In this project, currently under construction, I added a shell script that can calculate the number of the current week of my life. The script also allows entering a different date in the cases where I want to plug in a date and determine the week number for that specific date. That particular workflow is related to another small-ish project I'd like to work on, perhaps more news on that front will be available soon.

As I dig further into the fun and interesting layers of the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/), I have run across pages from various web authors like ones from the list below. I like the format, but I don't want to commit to an actual weekly schedule. So the number of the week in my VibeCheck posts indicates the number of the current week of my life, with the first week being the week I was born in late July 1978. I _think_ Robb Knight uses the same type of numbering scheme based on "week of life", however I don't recall exactly where I read that. Anyway, enjoy some vibe checks from this late-Generation X kiddo.
