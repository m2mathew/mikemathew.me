A few years back I stopped making resolutions at the start of the new year. It seems a bit arbitrary to make goals due to the calendar turning to a different day with an incremented year. I know this makes me sound like a snarky old man — not much argument here — but I think it best to set goals and/or establish new habits as soon as one is able. That being said, I have been pinning an area of _focus_ to each year, not a specific goal but more of a domain.

In 2020, long before the social distancing of COVID-19 canceled all of the world's plans, I made my own fitness a personal focus. My aim was not to build abs of steel or to get a trainer to beat me into a new and improved shape. Rather, I wanted to build the habit of thinking about and making time for fitness in my schedule and life. We have three kids at home, my wife and I work full-time, and I work as many minutes every day that I can on a [side project](https://www.presto-assistant.com/) that is _so close_ to launching.

So, how does one "make time" for fitness while being so busy? Great question! We have an indoor recumbent bicycle that is probably 9-10 years old now. There are so many miles on that machine! We keep the bicycle in our family room behind a great big L-shaped couch, and it is facing the television. This location tends to be mostly ideal for watching a show with the family in the evening or doing some light reading while using the bicycle for a workout.

Another helpful tool has been my Apple Watch. I have been wearing one most days since the second version came out a few years back. My curent one is the Series 4 in stainless steel with a white band. The "workout" app makes it really simple to start up a workout and quickly pause when getting up to refill water or if "nature calls" on a long bike ride. I have settled into a routine where my comfortable and do-able goal for the "Move" ring (active calories) is 820. I have found that making it go too much higher is tough to achieve some days — a 75-minute bike ride in the evenings is pretty brutal every single day. But I often exceed the goal of 820.

Near the end of 2020 we upped our family to the [Apple Super Duper Bundle](https://www.apple.com/apple-one/) that includes **Apple Fitness+**. Though I have only done a handful of workouts with the Apple Fitness+ app, I am "two thumbs up" on it so far. The integration with a user wearing an Apple Watch is really stinking cool. I can see my rings on the screen the entire workout, and the pace and energy feel good on the workouts that I did. I foresee more fitness routines via our Apple TV in the living room in 2021 for me.

In the summer of 2020 I dropped my Apple Watch and shattered the screen. No big deal overall, but the only three days the entire year I didn't wear my watch at all were the three days when a new one was being shipped to me.

Another aspect of fitness is the metric of weight. Most days I wake up in the 5 o'clock hour to start work on my side business. The very first thing in that early morning routine is stepping on the digital scale. This means I have enough data over the last few years to see trends. I _do_ see a trend in the times of the year where I lose more weight: Jan-Feb and the summer months. The rest of the months are a bit positive. My first guess for this is that I am motivated by the new year to start new habits, which die off by March. And then the summer is hotter, and I go outside more often and am generally more active.

## Moving forward into 2021

I look forward to mixing in more workouts from Apple Fitness+ this year. I am going to target some days each week to work on different aspects of fitness like core, HIIT, etc. Some of those days I will set my "Move" ring goal to be higher to help achieve a bit more caloric burn.

Now that fitness is an ingrained habit and an expectation for myself, it's time to add another variant to the mix: nutrition. My awareness of food intake is high, but I often succumb to the food and drink that ends up in our house. It is _much_ easier to avoid ice cream if it never makes it into the freezer at home! In order to not purchase all separate meals for the nutrition-concious person to eat, my entire family will need to consider nutrition more, too. This is a worthy task to undertake for the long-term health of my family. 2021 will be a grand adventure!
