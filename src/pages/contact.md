- For small/quick things, try [Mastodon](https://social.lol/@drumsensei).
  - I'll likely respond most quickly this way. 🚀
- If you have my phone number, that means we probably know each other. Send a message.
- You can try email at [drumsensei@omg.lol](mailto:drumsensei@omg.lol)
- I have a Twitter account, but it's dormant. I do not check it and have no intention to update it.
- I do have a Facebook account, mostly for keeping up with former co-workers and students.
  - I rarely use it, and I'm not keen to provide more "content" to any Meta company.

### When Reaching Out

- **What helps:** Provide a short bit of context and your expectations.
- **What I’m slow to respond to:** vague pitches, mass email blasts, and obviously spammy communication.
