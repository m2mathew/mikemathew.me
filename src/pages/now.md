I'm currently working on the redesign of this site. The goal is to combine the [old blog](https://www.drumsensei.com) and [portfolio site](https://www.mikemathew.com) into a single piece of internet. I've been reviewing and studying many independent sites from other IndieWeb types. This reminds me of when the internet was fun. We can make it that way again!

I ended 2025 by taking two full weeks off of work. I replayed an old favorite video game Fallout 4 and spent time with family.

At the top of 2026, we added a new family member Luca, a dog who is part Golden Retriever, part Great Dane. He's made us smile a lot after a tough 2025.
