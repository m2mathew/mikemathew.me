### My POSSE Workflow

Post content to a part of the internet that I own, i.e., my personal website. After that and _if I choose to_, I'll syndicate* the content to other platforms.

The IndieWeb calls this strategy [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE):

> POSSE is an abbreviation for Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere, the practice of posting content on your own site first, then publishing copies or sharing links to third parties.

* The automation of the syndication process is usually handled by tools like [EchoFeed](https://echofeed.app), which I'll be adding to this site soon.
