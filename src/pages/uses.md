### Hardware

- [16" MacBook Pro Max in Black](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/)
  - A beast of a machine.
- [Apple Studio Display](https://www.apple.com/studio-display/) x2
  - I like these way more than I expected.
- Microsoft Ergonomic Split Surface Keyboard.
  - Alas, Microsoft stopped making this keyboard.
- [Apple Magic Mouse](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/mxk63am/a/magic-mouse-usb), along with magic grips on the side
- [Apple Magic Trackpad](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/mxka3am/a/magic-trackpad-usb)
  - Useful for gestures.
- Acura MDX
  - My daily driver. It's definitely too big. My next vehicle will be much smaller.

### Software

- Visual Studio Code
  - My go-to code editor, though I toy with the idea of using WebStorm.
- Warp terminal
- Arc Browser
- TextExpander
- 1Password
