### Hardware

- [16" MacBook Pro Max in Black](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/)
  - A beast of a machine.
- [Apple Studio Display](https://www.apple.com/studio-display/) x2
  - I like these way more than I expected.
- Microsoft Ergonomic Split Surface Keyboard.
  - Alas, Microsoft stopped making this keyboard.
- [Apple Magic Mouse](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/mxk63am/a/magic-mouse-usb), along with magic grips on the side
- [Apple Magic Trackpad](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/mxka3am/a/magic-trackpad-usb)
  - Useful for gestures.
- [CalDigit TS4](https://www.caldigit.com/thunderbolt-station-4/)
  - Most everything I need in a single dock.
- Acura MDX
  - My daily driver. It's definitely too big. My next vehicle will be much smaller.

### Software

- [Omnifocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus)
  - Manage TODOs, complex projects, and everything in between
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - My go-to code editor, though I toy with the idea of using [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/).
- [Arc Browser](https://arc.net/)
  - This browser immediately clicked with me.
- [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/) by JetBrains
  - I work in PostgreSQL a bunch, and this app helps me query the databases.
- [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) terminal
  - Modern terminal. I work around the "AI" bits as those don't interest me.
- [Mimestream](https://mimestream.com/)
  - Gmail client but it looks like macOS Mail.app. The "unread" view is so useful.
- [TextExpander](https://textexpander.com/)
  - I'm on a decade-plus streak of using snippets to save time 💪
- [1Password](https://1password.com/)
  - Whole family uses it.
- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/)
  - Wrangle the windows.
- [Hand Mirror](https://handmirror.app/)
  - Check out the scene before any video calls start.
- [Ivory](https://tapbots.com/ivory/), a Mastodon client
  - From the fine folks who made Tweetbot in days gone by.
- [Cleanshot X](https://cleanshot.com/)
  - Easy screenshots and GIFs :chefs-kiss:
- [Easy CSV Editor](https://vdt-labs.com/easy-csv-editor/)
  - So easy
- [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/)
  - We've been using this at Presto to manage tasks and as a Notion replacement. It's been pretty nice.
