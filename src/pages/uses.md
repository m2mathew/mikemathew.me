### Hardware

- [16" MacBook Pro Max in Black](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/)
  - A beast of a machine.
- [Apple Studio Display](https://www.apple.com/studio-display/) x2
  - I like these way more than I expected.
- Microsoft Ergonomic Split Surface Keyboard.
  - Alas, Microsoft stopped making this keyboard.
- [Apple Magic Mouse](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/mxk63am/a/magic-mouse-usb), along with magic grips on the side
- [Apple Magic Trackpad](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/mxka3am/a/magic-trackpad-usb)
  - Useful for gestures.
- [CalDigit TS4](https://www.caldigit.com/thunderbolt-station-4/)
  - Most everything I need in a single dock.
- Acura MDX
  - My daily driver. It's definitely too big. My next vehicle will be much smaller.

### Software

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - My go-to code editor, though I toy with the idea of using [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/).
- [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/) by JetBrains
  - I work in PostgreSQL a bunch, and this app helps me query the databases.
- [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) terminal
  - Modern terminal. I work around the "AI" bits as those don't interest me.
- Arc Browser
- [TextExpander](https://textexpander.com/)
  - I'm on a decade-plus streak of using snippets to save time 💪
- 1Password
- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/)
  - Wrangle the windows.
