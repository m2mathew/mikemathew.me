My goal for this project is to be human-made as much as possible. As such, I write the words here, no robots involved.


I don't use AI for:
- Writing words
- Images

Light AI use might include:
- Auto-complete in my text editor for things that I was about to write (though, about 80% of the time it's just wrong and annoying, probably a sign that I should disable it)
- Occasionally I'll run into some programming issue that my Mike human brain can't handle. I'll dip into AI-land for a few minutes for a hint on next steps. I'd peg this as a once-per-month type of event.

In 2025, at the behest _the industry leaders_, I did attempt to use generative AI for a while. I noticed that my cognitive skills regarding writing and reading code were diminishing. I cut off many sources of AI that had been thrown my direction, pleased to do nearly all of it myself.
