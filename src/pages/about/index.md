I work as a developer/designer & musician based out of the Dallas/Fort Worth area. I like to make nice things that help people. Since December 2015 I have worked as a software engineer at [Text-Em-All](https://www.text-em-all.com/) in Frisco, TX (formerly named Call-Em-All). I also founded and continue to organize the [ReactJS Dallas software meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Dallas/). My software development career kicked off at the (former) code school in Austin, Texas called The Iron Yard. In ye olden pre-pandemic times, I occasionally helped mentor young coding ninjas at the Frisco Coder Dojo, which no longer meets.

In late 2018 I co-founded [Presto Assistant](https://www.presto-assistant.com/), a service to help fine arts teachers and administrators organize their logistics and office. This app makes the lives of fine arts teachers better by helping them get and stay organized. It's been a lot of fun to build a product that helps teachers have a better day. At Presto I use the fancy title of "_Director of Product_", but I'm also writing code and doing lots of tasks behind the scenes to keep the company running each day.

As a longtime musician and music educator I worked with some terrific programs as a performer and teacher. The list is long but includes such powerhouses as Texas A&M University-Commerce (now East Texas A&M University), Lakeview Centennial High School, Berkner High School, North Mesquite High School, Trinity High School, Forney High School, Flower Mound High School, Texas Christian University, University of Texas at Arlington, and several others all over the state of Texas. On occasion I can be seen hitting drums or marimbas or timpani. I get to play drums at church some weekends, so my funky beats continue to thrive.

My most important work: husband to my lovely wife (25+ years now), father to my three wonderful children, and big brother to many half-siblings. I enjoy any good music, Apple computers and products, and the Oxford comma. By night I stay up learning everything that I don't yet know, or I read about how I should be sleeping more. My family and friends are awesome and a continual blessing in my life.
