          Mike is an incredible engineer and an even better human being. I had the privilege of meeting Mike years ago at local meetups, learning from him during my internship at Text-Em-All, and collaborating with him as a co-organizer of the ReactJS Dallas meetup.

          From a technical perspective, Mike is exceptionally thorough in his research and understanding of technology which enables him to choose the right tools for the right problems. His technical aptitude is matched by his natural ability to teach (a skill honed from his previous career in education). Mike continuously elevates those around him, whether through mentorship, knowledge sharing, or fostering collaboration.

          Beyond his technical and teaching strengths, Mike is a true community builder. For over a decade, he has led and facilitated ReactJS Dallas, creating a space where thousands of developers and aspiring engineers have connected, learned, and grown. His passion for the community and his welcoming demeanor produce positive and inspiring interactions. Mike’s infectious energy and inclusive approach create an environment where people feel safe to learn and thrive.

          I am grateful for the impact Mike has had on my career and the broader developer community. Any team or organization would be fortunate to have him.

          Working with Mike is a superlative experience in so many respects. Acting as a senior team member, he is consistently generous with his time, never hesitating to explain a concept, provide his expertise and knowledge, or take the time to communicate effectively and thoroughly to others. He is a key leader on the frontend team in terms of new technologies, developing and maintaining best practices across the code base, and architecting new patterns, including advocating for and spearheading the conversion of our entire app to Typescript. He is our local expert on accessibility, CSS, and UI practices as well, bridging a gap between the engineers and our product team, and often spotting issues or opportunities for modernizing that we otherwise would not. He brings an indefatigable attention to detail and minutiae to all his work, big and small. Mike is a true joy to work with and embodies the example of a team member who leads by example and inspiration!
