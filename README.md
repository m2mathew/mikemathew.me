# mikemathew.me

Don't call it a comeback, I've been working on this for years. 🎤

This project combines my old weblog at drumsensei.com with my personal site mikemathew.com.

## Prior Versions

Back in mid-2015, I started the drumsensei.com blog using RapidWeaver. I was a baby web developer, and I was getting started on deeper learning about web technologies. That timeframe is when I was switching gears from full-time band director in public education to making cool things on the web.

In late-2015, I added mikemathew.com as a personal and/or portfolio site. Some of my work from The Iron Yard was shown there...but all of those projects are probably decrepit now [cut to dystopian scene with tumbleweeds blowing across the empty city streets].

In the 2027-18 era, I changed the drumsensei.com site to a Gatsby site. I was entrenched in the React ecosystem, and Gatsby was an easy way to build a static site with too much JavaScript.

## Present Day

Years later I stumbled upon [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), which might be unavoidable if you follow smart people with great taste like the humans linked below. 11ty is rad. This project is based on a mixture of ideas and patterns found in a smattering of places. I'm chuffed to work on such a project.
